**QuackOps** is a powerful `kubectl` s a powerful kubectl AI-agent `kubectl` plugin designed to enhance your Kubernetes troubleshooting experience with advanced AI assistance. It acts as an intelligent agent, translating natural language queries into actionable insights by analyzing diagnostics directly from your current Kubernetes context.

Built with flexibility in mind, QuackOps works seamlessly with various LLM providers to suit your needs. Whether you prioritize privacy with local models like [llama3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) or seek advanced capabilities with cloud-based LLMs, QuackOps has you covered.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface:** Interact with your cluster using plain English. Ask complex questions like "Why is my StatefulSet not scaling?" or "Find pods using too much CPU" and receive context-aware assistance.

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Automatically analyzes your cluster state by running relevant `kubectl` commands and leverages AI to interpret results, identify issues, and suggest solutions.

- **Multi-Model Support:** Choose the LLM that fits your requirements:
  - **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** - Run models locally for complete data privacy and air-gapped environments
  - **[Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)** - Process massive outputs with 1M+ token context windows

## üíª Example

```sh
$ kubectl quackops -v 'find and resolve issues with pods'

kubectl get pods
-- NAME                                            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
-- my-nginx-ingress-hello-world-6d8c5b76db-g5696   1/1     Running            14 (149m ago)   58d
-- test-21081                                      1/1     Running            22 (149m ago)   95d
-- example-hello-world-5cd56d45d5-8nh5x            1/1     Running            2 (149m ago)    17d
-- my-nginx-ingress-hello-world-64f78448bd-v567q   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0               28d
--

kubectl get events
-- LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON    OBJECT                                              MESSAGE
-- 4m45s       Normal   BackOff   pod/my-nginx-ingress-hello-world-64f78448bd-v567q   Back-off pulling image "nginx:v1.16.0"
--

Based on the information provided:
- The pod `my-nginx-ingress-hello-world-64f78448bd-v567q` is not working
because it is in the `ImagePullBackOff` status which means it is unable to
pull the specified image `nginx:v1.16.0`.

- The issue is likely related to the incorrect image specified or the image
not being available in the specified repository.

To resolve the issue, you can check the image availability, correct the image
name or tag, ensure the repository access is correct, and troubleshoot any
network issues that may be preventing the pod from pulling the image.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Examples

### Complex Troubleshooting

```sh
$ kubectl quackops 'why is my ingress not routing traffic properly to backend services?'
```

### Performance Analysis

```sh
$ kubectl quackops 'identify pods consuming excessive CPU or memory in the production namespace'
```

### Security Auditing

```sh
$ kubectl quackops 'check for overly permissive RBAC settings in my cluster'
```

### Multi-Resource Analysis

```sh
$ kubectl quackops 'analyze the connection between my failing deployments and their dependent configmaps'
```

## üîÑ Shell Completions

QuackOps provides intelligent tab completion for command execution mode (commands starting with `$`), leveraging bash-compatible shell completions:

- **Command Completions:** When typing `$ `, type and press Tab to see available commands.
- **Argument Completions:** QuackOps supports completions for cli tools like `kubectl`, `helm`, and other CLI tools that implement completion.
- **File Path Completions:** Automatically complete file paths when navigating the filesystem.

Note that completions rely on bash-compatible shell completion functions being available on your system. The feature works best in environments where bash completion is properly configured.

### Example Usage

```sh
$ kubectl <tab>              # Shows kubectl subcommands
$ kubectl get po<tab>        # Completes to 'pods'
$ kubectl get pods -n <tab>  # Shows available namespaces
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

QuackOps is designed with security in mind, but there are important considerations for using it in production environments:

- **Use Read-Only Kubernetes Users:** For maximum safety, operate with a read-only Kubernetes user when interacting with the cluster through this plugin.

- **Enable Safe Mode:** In production environments, activate the `--safe-mode` option to ensure all commands are manually reviewed before execution.

- **Data Privacy:** By default, QuackOps filters sensitive data from secrets before sending to LLMs. Disable this only if you understand the implications.

- **Command Restrictions:** The tool prevents execution of potentially destructive commands. Configure additional blocked commands with the `QU_KUBECTL_BLOCKED_CMDS_EXTRA` environment variable.

- **Local Models:** For sensitive environments, use Ollama with local models to ensure your cluster data never leaves your infrastructure.
